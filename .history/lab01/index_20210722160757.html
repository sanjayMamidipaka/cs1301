        What's up world? My name is Sanjay and I'll be a freshman in the fall. Im from New Jersey and I'm so excited to live in Atlanta this year.
        Unfortunately, I'm a pretty big Saints fan big and I'll be living in rival territory. Something else about me is that I love music. My favorite artist is Kanye but 
        I also enjoy Drake, Travis Scott, Kid Cudi, and a healthy dose of 2010s pop.
